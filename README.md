# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Victor Mattos,

Work in tech for more then a decade. Started as Web Developer, moved to Data Scientist (but the meaning of this title is probably not what you think), became a Data Solutions Architect and now I'm a Data Engineer.

## Personality

I'm a INTP (if you don't know what it means [check this.](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)). Which means deph of knowladge is kinda my thing. But I also have ADHD, so I usually go for the next interesting thing.

My main experience is to create data platforms/areas from scratch. I like to envision the future and create projects to reach it.

## What you will find in my github repos?

I try to keep it clean, so usually delete or make it private repos that I don't see as being relevant anymore (deprecated techniques/tools).

The type of repos that you'll find here probably will be:
* Course repositories - I do a lot of courses (really...) and sometimes you'll find repositories from these, but they wont be there for long.
* Learning projects - Not often (but neither rarelly) I create some projects to test my knowledge. Since this is a public environment, I tend to over engineer stuff (that's why you'll probably find few of these).
* Technology evaluation - I always look for new technologies, so sometimes I'll put my logics, tests and conclusions in here. (These repos have the same problem from the Learning ones)
* Auxiliar projects - This type of repo will contain stuff that support other stuff, like dot files, general automation scripts and others...
