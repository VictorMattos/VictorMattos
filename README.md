# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Victor Mattos,

I'm a INTP (if you don't know what it means [check this.](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)), so I tend to let my personal projects open and unfinished.  
Insted of denying it, I'll accept it and do my best to evolve (meaning that I'll try to balance my personality traits).  

With that being said: I'll try to keep my repositories as clean as possible, but wont make any promisse.  
Also, make no mistake. Despite having a focus problem, I also like to get as deep knowledge, in any subject, as I can possibly can (and I usually can a lot).

So with the disclaimer being said...

## What you will find in my github repos?

The type of repos that you'll find here probably will be:
* Course repositories - I do a lot of courses (really...) and sometimes you'll find repositories from these, but they wont be there for long.
* Learning projects - Not often (but neither rarelly) I create some projects to test my knowledge. Since this is a public environment, I tend to over engineer stuff (that's why you'll probably find few of these).
* Technology evaluation - I always look for new technologies, so sometimes I'll put my logics, tests and conclusions in here. (These repos have the same problem from the Learning ones)
* Auxiliar projects - This type of repo will contain stuff that support other stuff, like dot files, general automation scripts and others...
